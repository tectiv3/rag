The GeForce RTX 4080 is an enthusiast-class graphics card by NVIDIA, launched on September 20th, 2022. Built on the 5 nm process, and based on the AD103 graphics processor, in its AD103-300-A1 variant, the card supports DirectX 12 Ultimate. This ensures that all modern games will run on GeForce RTX 4080. Additionally, the DirectX 12 Ultimate capability guarantees support for hardware-raytracing, variable-rate shading and more, in upcoming video games. The AD103 graphics processor is a large chip with a die area of 379 mmÂ² and 45,900 million transistors. It features 9728 shading units, 304 texture mapping units, and 112 ROPs. Also included are 304 tensor cores which help improve the speed of machine learning applications. The card also has 76 raytracing acceleration cores. NVIDIA has paired 16 GB GDDR6X memory with the GeForce RTX 4080, which are connected using a 256-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 2205 MHz, which can be boosted up to 2505 MHz, memory is running at 1400 MHz (22.4 Gbps effective).
Being a triple-slot card, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 draws power from 1x 16-pin power connector, with power draw rated at 320 W maximum. Display outputs include: 1x HDMI 2.1, 3x DisplayPort 1.4a. GeForce RTX 4080 is connected to the rest of the system using a PCI-Express 4.0 x16 interface. The card's dimensions are 310 mm x 140 mm x 61 mm, and it features a triple-slot cooling solution. Its price at launch was 1199 US Dollars.
